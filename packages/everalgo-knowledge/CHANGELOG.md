## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `KnowledgeExtractor`: full file-based knowledge extraction pipeline — `ParsedContent → list[KnowledgeMemory]` via preprocess + atomize → per-batch topic-tree LLM extraction → cross-batch merge → postprocess (split unsplit leaves + assign uncovered blocks) → tree assembly + DFS flatten. Multi-provider LLM client; tiktoken-bounded batching. Ships English prompts, unit + functional tests, a CLI walkthrough script, and an HTML visualizer.
- `aclassify_category` / `classify_category`: document-level classification against a caller-owned `CategorySpec` taxonomy. Single LLM call, closed-set; parse failure / out-of-set collapses to `""`. Integrated into `KnowledgeExtractor.aextract` via `categories=` / `category_id=` kwargs.
