"""Block splitting and token batching for ``KnowledgeExtractor``.

Pure-compute stage 1 of the extraction pipeline. No LLM calls, no I/O.
Normalizes parsed text, splits it into numbered atom blocks (paragraphs
with table / list merging), and groups atoms into token-bounded batches
ready for sequential LLM windows.

Higher-level normalization (HTML -> Markdown, table-marker injection) is
the parser's responsibility, not knowledge's. Callers that have already
emitted ``TABLE_START_MARKER`` / ``TABLE_END_MARKER`` around HTML-derived
tables get whole-table atoms; callers that have not pay no cost.

NOT exposed in the package ``__all__`` — these utilities are internal to
the knowledge extractor pipeline.
